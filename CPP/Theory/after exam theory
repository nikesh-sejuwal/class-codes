      		INHERITANCE IN CPP

  It is the process of acquering properties of base class by a derived class.

  Here is an algorithm for the code implementation of Boolean matrix operations join, meet, and Boolean Product in C language:

Include the necessary header files stdio.h, stdlib.h, and stdbool.h.
Define the constant ROW and COL to determine the number of rows and columns of the matrices.
Define three functions join, meet, and BooleanProduct to perform the respective operations.
join returns the result of the logical OR of two Boolean values.
meet returns the result of the logical AND of two Boolean values.
BooleanProduct returns the result of comparing two Boolean values for equality.
In the main function, declare three matrices A, B, and C to store the input matrices and the result of operations.
Read the elements of matrices A and B from the user.
Perform the join operation by iterating over the elements of matrices A and B and storing the result in matrix C.
Print the result of the join operation stored in matrix C.
Perform the meet operation by iterating over the elements of matrices A and B and storing the result in matrix C.
Print the result of the meet operation stored in matrix C.
Perform the BooleanProduct operation by iterating over the elements of matrices A and B and storing the result in matrix C.
Print the result of the BooleanProduct operation stored in matrix C.
Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
